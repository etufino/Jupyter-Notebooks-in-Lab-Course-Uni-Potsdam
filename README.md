This is a public repository of resources, designed and developed by Eugenio Tufino (Uni Trento, www.unitn.it) and Micol Alemani for the Physics Lab Course taught by Dr. Micol Alemani at University of Potsdam (www.physik.uni-potsdam.de/) in November 2022.


**Python Data Analysis curriculum**
This curriculum has been integrated into the introductory laboratory course at the University of Potsdam, focusing on Python for data analysis.

**Repository Structure**
Note: Files are available in two languages: English (_EN) and German (DE).

**Getting Started**

This folder includes four Jupyter Notebooks that introduce the course's fundamental concepts:

    First Laboratory Session: Explore various Jupyter Notebook platforms and their setup procedures. Gain an understanding of basic calculations, text formatting, LaTeX usage, and simple plot creation.

    Second Laboratory Session: Dive into scientific libraries, manipulate Pandas dataframes, conduct linear fits, and investigate statistical measures such as χ² and r². Introduction to creating histograms.

**Application Examples**
(Five Jupyter Notebooks)
Leverage Python to analyze real-world physics phenomena through five Jupyter Notebooks:

    Analyze sunspot time-series data using the moving average.
    Examine the relationship between light source illuminance and distance.
    Create histograms to explore the oscillation period of a pendulum.
    Simulate parabolic motion.
    Visualize atmospheric CO2 data from online sources.

**Additional Techniques**
Two Jupyter Notebooks to improve the skills on importing and manipulating data files across diverse platforms, including Jupyter Lab-Anaconda, Google Colab, and direct internet sources.

**Exercises for the Second Semester**

This folder contains exercises and data files used in the assessment at the beginning of the second semester.
