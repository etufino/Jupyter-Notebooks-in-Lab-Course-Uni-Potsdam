This is a public repository of resources, designed and developed by Eugenio Tufino (Uni Trento, www.unitn.it) and Micol Alemani for the Physics Lab Course taught by Dr. Micol Alemani at University of Potsdam (www.physik.uni-potsdam.de/)in November 2022.


**Python Data Analysis curriculum implemented in the introductory laboratory course at the University of Potsdam (Germany)
**

**Introduction (Four Jupyter Notebooks)**

    First Laboratory Session: Dive into different Jupyter Notebook platforms and their installation processes. You'll get a feel for basic calculations, text formatting, using Latex, and creating basic plots.

    Second Laboratory Session: Here, we delve into scientific libraries, working with Pandas dataframes, performing linear fits, and exploring statistical quantities such as χ² and r². We also introduce histogram creation.

**Application Examples (Five Jupyter Notebooks)
**
Use Python to explore and analyze real-world physics phenomena:

Calculate the moving average applied to sunspot time-series.Plot and analyze the relationship between light source illuminance and distance.
    Create histograms to study the period of oscillation of a pendulum. Simulate parabolic motion. Plot atmospheric CO2 data sourced from online platforms.

**Additional Techniques (Two Jupyter Notebooks)
**

To improve the skills on importing and manipulating data files across diverse platforms, including Jupyter Lab-Anaconda, Google Colab, and direct internet sources.
