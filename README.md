**Python Data Analysis curriculum**

This curriculum has been integrated into the introductory laboratory course at the University of Potsdam, focusing on Python for data analysis.

**Repository Structure**

Note: All files are provided with an English version, denoted by the suffix _EN. Files available in German are marked with the _DE suffix.

**Getting_Started**

This folder contains four Jupyter Notebooks that introduce the fundamental lab computational concepts within the course:

First Laboratory Session: Explore various Jupyter Notebook platforms and their setup procedures. Gain an understanding of basic calculations, text formatting, LaTeX usage, and simple plot creation.

Second Laboratory Session: This session focuses on scientific libraries, manipulate Pandas dataframes, conduct linear fits, and investigate statistical measures such as χ² and r². Introduction to creating histograms.

**Application_Examples**

This folder contains five Jupyter Notebooks, to use Use Python to investigate real-world physics phenomena:

Analyze sunspot time-series data using the moving average.
Examine the relationship between light source illuminance and distance.
Create histograms to explore the oscillation period of a pendulum.
Simulate parabolic motion.
Visualize atmospheric CO2 data from online sources.

**Additional_Techniques**

Two Jupyter Notebooks to improve the skills on importing and manipulating data files across diverse platforms, including Jupyter Lab-Anaconda, Google Colab, and direct internet sources.

**Exercises_Start_Second_Semester**

This folder contains exercises and data files used in the assessment at the beginning of the second semester.
