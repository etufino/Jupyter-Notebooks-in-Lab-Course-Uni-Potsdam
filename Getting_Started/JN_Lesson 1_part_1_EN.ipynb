You can install Anaconda on your computer for free if you wish. If you have a Google account already, you can open and run all the notebooks you get in the basic lab with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as well. Colab is already pre-installed in your Google Drive by Google. However, a Google account is required for Google Colab. If you do not want to install Anaconda and you do not have a Google account, you have the option of running the notebooks in a browser. To do this, go to the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) page and click on \"Try\" and there on \"Jupiter Notebook\" or go directly to [JupyterTry](https://jupyter.org/try). In the following we refer to Jupiter **Notebooks with Anaconda** using JupyterLab.\n",
