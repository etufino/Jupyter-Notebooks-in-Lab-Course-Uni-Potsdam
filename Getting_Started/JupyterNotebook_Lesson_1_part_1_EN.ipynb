You will find Anaconda pre-installed on the computers in the lab. You can install Anaconda on your computers for free if you want. If you have a Google account already, you can also open and run all the notebooks you get in our course with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Colab is already pre-installed in your Google Drive by Google. However, a Google account is required for Google Colab. If you don't want to install Anaconda and you don't have a Google account, then you have the option to run the notebooks in a browser. To do this, go to the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) webpage and click on \"Try\" and there on \"Jupiter Notebook\" or go directly to [JupyterTry](https://jupyter.org/try). In the following we refer to Jupiter Notebooks with Anaconda (using JupyterLab).\n","\n","\n","**Literature**: \n","\n","At the end of this notebook you can find a list of useful literature about Python programming and the use of Jupyter Notebooks for scientific applications .\n","\n","**Let's start :-)...** \n","\n","In a notebook you have cells where you can write codes and cells where you can write text and formulas or insert images and videos.
